// Part 1: Humble Beginnings
// Let’s model a simple adventurer with basic properties such as health and an inventory. 
// We will call the adventurer “Robin.”

const adventurer = {
name: "Robin",
health: 10,
inventory: ["sword", "potion", "artifact"]

//Nested arrays are useful, but so are nested objects. Let’s give Robin a companion to travel with – a furry friend they call “Leo.”
companion:{
    name: "Leo",
    type: "Cat"

    companion.subSubject: 
}
}


// Next, give Robin’s feline friend a friend of his own:
// Add a “companion” sub-object to “Leo” with the following properties:
// The companion’s name is “Frank.”
// The companion’s type is “Flea.”
// The companion has its own belongings, which includes a small hat and sunglasses.
